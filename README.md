# Website Summarizer
This project is a web-based content summarization tool built with Streamlit and powered by LangChain and Groq API. The application allows users to input a website URL, fetches the webpage content using UnstructuredURLLoader, and generates a 300-word summary using the Gemma2-9B-IT model.

The app includes real-time validation for input URLs, interactive UI elements, and error handling to manage failed requests. It leverages LangChainâ€™s summarization chain for efficient text processing. This tool is useful for quickly understanding web content, research purposes, and information extraction.
